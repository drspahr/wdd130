            Welcome! This site has been set up to answer, at a high level, how pipeline companies address the
            damage caused by corrosion on their underground assets. On the following pages, you will find the
            basics of corrosion, why pipelines corrode, and how they are protected from corrosion. Over the 18
            years I've been in the pipeline corrosion industry, I've had to try and explain this threat and what it is I
            do to mitigate to many different people. This site will take an approach that most people should have a
            basic understanding of pipeline corrosion and the steps that are taken to protect pipelines from it.
            Something to consider, as we work to protect these structures from the threat of corrosion, we are also
            protecting the communities and environments that pipes are routed through. As a corrosion specialist, I
            feel my responsibility goes beyond the company I work, but to the people and environments wherein
            the assets I am responsible for are located.
