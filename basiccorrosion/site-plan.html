        Welcome!
        This site has been set up to answer, at a high level, how pipeline companies address the damage caused by corrosion on their underground assets. On the following pages, you will find the basics of corrosion, why pipelines corrode, and how they are protected from corrosion.

        Over the 18 years I’ve been in the pipeline corrosion industry, I’ve had to try and explain this threat and what it is I do to mitigate to many different people. This site will take an approach that most people should have a basic understanding of pipeline corrosion and the steps that are taken to protect pipelines from it.

        Something to consider, as we work to protect these structures from the threat of corrosion, we are also protecting the communities and environments that pipes are routed through. As a corrosion specialist, I feel my responsibility goes beyond the company I work, but to the people and environments wherein the assets I am responsible for are located.

          intransitive verb
          : to undergo corrosion
          
          “Corrode.” Merriam-Webster.com Dictionary, Merriam-Webster, https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/corrode. Accessed 5 Nov. 2022.
          </p>
      <p>As can be seen from the definition from Merriam-Webster, corrosion is the act of being eaten away by degrees. On pipelines this can be a gradual wearing away, or it can happen rapidly. Why does it occur?

        Because we are discussing corrosion on a pipeline, let’s look at the element iron (Fe). This is the predominate element in a typical steel pipeline. 
        
        
            Fe:
        
        Iron is inherently unstable due to the low numbers of electrons in its outer most electron shell. When placed in an electrolyte, iron will give up those electrons to become stable. We often will see the results of this in the form of rust. A great example of this is when you see vehicles from coastal or northern regions. On the coast, the salt that is in the air, or if a vehicle is driven on a beach, will accelerate the corrosion process. In the northern regions, salt is used to prevent and remove snow from roadways. Vehicles to go long period of time without the road salt being cleaned, will show signs of rust. 
        
        There are four requirements to have corrosion.
        1.	Anode
        2.	Cathode
        3.	Metallic path
        4.	Electrolyte
        The anode is the positive side of the corrosion circuit
        The cathode is the negative side of the corrosion circuit
        The metallic path is the path of the electrons
        The electrolyte is the path of the ions.
        
        When corrosion occurs, the ion of the base material will move from the anode, through the electrolyte to the cathode. The electrons will move from the anode to the cathode through the metallic path.            
      </p>
      <h3>Pipeline Corrosion</h3>
      <p>
        Pipelines are made predominately from iron. However, several other elements are added in the alloying process to produce the steels commonly used in pipelines. This requires a lot of energy to be added to the metal, making it an unstable compound. It is very susceptible to corrosion once installed.

        Additional energy is added to the pipe when it is constructed on site. Each segment is welded together with a girth weld. These areas exhibit faster corrosion rates when buried.

        Three of the four elements required for corrosion are inherent to the pipe. Anodes, cathodes, and the metallic path. 

        When buried, the pipe surface is in direct contact with a stable, generally moist electrolyte. This is when the real danger can occur.

        Looking a figure 1, with the electrolyte against the surface of the pipe, an increase in corrosion activity begins to take place. The anodic portions of the pipe begin to give off ions to the electrolyte, and they begin moving to the cathodic zones. The electrons also move towards the cathodic areas via the pipe itself.

      <h3>Pipeline Corrosion Mitigation</h3>
      <p>
        How do we keep a pipeline from corroding?

        There are two processes that are commonly used.
        1.	The pipeline is coated with a system that has a high resistance to current flow and is a barrier between the pipe and the electrolyte.
        2.	Cathodic protection systems are installed to protect those portions of the pipe that, for whatever reason, does not have a coating system. Generally, these are areas of damage to the coating system.

        When these two systems are installed and maintained properly, corrosion on a pipeline can be reduced to near zero.

        Coating systems are the first line of defense. They are generally applied by the manufacturer of the pipe and applied in the field by the construction company. Testing is done to ensure the system will perform as designed. Common systems are Fusion Bonded Epoxy (FBE), the most common today; wraps, either a textile with mastic backing or tapes; and abrasive resistant systems, typically added over the top of on FBE system when a pipe must be pulled under a road or railroad.

        Cathodic Protection systems are the second line of defense. They supplement the coating system. There are two types of systems: galvanic and impressed. 
        In a galvanic system, magnesium, zinc or aluminum anodes are used. They are attached directly to the pipe and through the natural process, will protect the pipe. They are often referred to as a sacrificial system since the anodes will natural sacrifice themselves to protect the steel.

        With an impressed system, current is impressed onto the pipe using a rectifier and anodes. The typical anodes used in these systems are graphite, silicon cast iron, mixed metal oxides. These materials do not sacrifice to protect the pipeline, which is why a rectifier is typically used to drive current from the anodes to the pipeline.
