    <h2>David Spahr</h2>
    <p>Hello class! My name is David Spahr. I am currently living in Hutchinson, KS. I have been married to my bride for 20 years and counting. We were sealed in 2006, along with our daughter. Our son was born in the covenant, but very recently (2019).</p>
    <p>I have spent the past 18 years working in the oil and gas industry as a corrosion specialists. Before that I drove over the road, before that I was working on airplanes. Over the years I have dabbled in woodworking, flying, cycling, working on a recent project car, and various other interests.</p>
    <p>I am currently working on the Applied Technology BS. My interest in programing began in the late 1990's, about the time I joined the church, when I took a job with a small company in Denver, learning and writing in COBOL. At the time I was in school for an Associates electronics. Following a prompting I had last year, I am returning to school, having completed the Pathway Connect program in July.</p>
